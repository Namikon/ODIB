# ODIB
OreDict blocks from Ingots (OreDictIngotBlocks)

With ODIB, you can create custom blocks that can be configured by just changing a config file.
Unbreakable glowstone? Deal. Obsidian that can catch on fire? Check.
Just add an Enderium block to build that fancy big reactors turbine without Thermal Expansion installed? Yep.

Much more to come!

- Potion effects (You should get damage when holding an Uranium block...)
- Particle effects
- Physics (Falling obsidian for your map)
